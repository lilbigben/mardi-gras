        <h1>FAQs</h1>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
            claims of
            businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term
            “official” is
            just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or
            websites are not
            licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
            merchandise. In
            some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true
            in New
            Orleans.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat
            Tuesday),
            however, is on a different day each year.

            Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is
            always the
            day before Ash Wednesday.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from
            one
            extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may
            turn into a
            warm afternoon.

            Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
            dirty. Don’t
            forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a
            raincoat!</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a
            balcony, food and
            a bathroom pass.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How much does it cost to go to Mardi Gras?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call it
            the "Greatest
            Free Show on Earth!"</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend
            when Bacchus
            and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets
            are packed all
            day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and
            Fat Tuesday
            are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and
            the Zulu
            Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
            costumes
            and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What happens if there is bad weather?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be severe.
            The local TV
            and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew up
            in New
            Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we used to
            use "taking
            the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will
            catch. Throws
            often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

            The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We
            recommend
            seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last until 11 p.m.
            near the end
            of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families
            staking out
            their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees.
            You don't
            have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

            You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which is only
            10 minutes
            away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade
            Disneyworld
            features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it</p>
